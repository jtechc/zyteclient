## zytesasdch

An annoyingly average discord.js command handler that is very work in progress.

Not really sure what to put here but GH told me to make one

#### Handler works simply by requiring it in your project main

```javascript
const zytesasdch = require('zytesasdch');
```

Oh I'll work on this later...
